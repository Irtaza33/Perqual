                <p style="color:black;font-size: 18px;">The Research on the subject mentioned in the heading above was finally presented by Dr.Ali Zulqarnain. He works as an Assitant Professor at the Department of Industrail & Manufacturing - NED Univesrsity of Engineering & Technology in Karachi,Pakistan. The purpose of the research which took several years, is to develop a Quality Management Framework for assessing the Quality Performanceof Auto PartsManufacturers in line with the stan- dard requirements of local and global automobile assemblers and guidelines of worldrenowned performance excellence models. Furthermore, this research proposes a generic Quality 4.0 (Digitized) framework that is integrated with the proposed framework of QM in order to realize the emerging demand for the sustainability of digitization and connectivity.</p>

                    <p style="color:black;font-size: 18px;">A literature review highlighted the domains where more research is required before develop- ing the required QM framework for the assess- ment of the quality performance of APMs. Com- petency levels of APMS (major work) along with other local and global (minor work) organiza- tions are assessed through statistical analysis by employing the licensed versions of statistical software. An assessment of competence level also revealed the areas where more effort is needed to establish a framework that would serve the demands of automobile assemblers. The development of the QM framework has incorpo- rated the valuable feedback of industry experts of APMs and automobile assemblers (OEMs).</p>
